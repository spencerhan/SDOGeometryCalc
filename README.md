# ArcObject Addin to calculate SDO_GEOM value

Geometry for Oracle Spatial Object is only obtainable via DML query by using SDO_GEOM function. 

This is a deal breaker for WRC to fetch geometry values e.g. area/length.

This project intends to...

* Develop a plugin for ArcMap
* Connecting ArcMap to spatial data stored in Oracle via Enterprise geodatabase.
* Calculate geometry value for these spatial objects. 
* Automatically label features in ArcMap based on their geometry value.
* Consistently listening on geometry changes in Oracle.
* Updating static column to store geometry values in real numbers.


### Wooo!
